# Controllers and Scope

- Controller is primary responsibility to create a scope object.
- A Scope object is how we communicate with view. **Two Way Communication**
- The view can bind the properties and values from the scope.
- Scope is not the model.
- Model put the data into the scope
- Modify the model means need **methods to modify on the scope**
- Same as **Events fired by views**
