# Transclusion - Transclusion and Scopes

- Controller and directive used same scope only
- Good is we use the data.
- Bad is data overwrite.
- Given to directive ***scope is true*** data not overwritten.
- Added the inner controller
- Use the console.log to print scopes and check the child and parent scopes.
