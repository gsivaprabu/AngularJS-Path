	- Every property has type
	- Every method has type

## Interface

 A **specification** identifying a related set of properties and methods.

A class commits to supporting the specification by **implementing** the interface.

Use the interface as a **data type**.

Development time only!

***ES5 & ES2015*** do not support interface but typescript supports interface

Interfaces are **development time** only
